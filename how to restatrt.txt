QUESTION :
so even if now i want to run this whole setup on another codespace with another account so i have to just import 
the project in that codespace and i can run this normally like i am doing right now. right??? 

ANSWER :
Yes! 🎉 You can run this entire setup on another Codespace (or even another GitHub account) by importing the 
project and running the startup script. Here’s how:

✅ Steps to Run on Another Codespace
Step 1: Clone the Repository into a New Codespace
On the new GitHub account or Codespace, open a terminal and run:

code >>>  {
    git clone <your-repo-url> dockerr
    cd dockerr
}

Step 2: Make Startup & Stop Scripts Executable
Since .sh files might lose their executable permission, run this once:

code >>>  {
    chmod +x start.sh stop.sh
}

Step 3: Start Everything
Simply run:

code >>>  {
    ./start.sh
}

Crafty will start ✅
Playit tunnel will connect automatically ✅
Minecraft server files will load ✅
All configurations will stay the same ✅

Step 4: Stop Everything When Needed
To stop everything, run:

code >>>  {
    ./stop.sh
}

🔥 Now, You Can Use This Anywhere!
✔ Just import the repo into any Codespace.
✔ No extra setup needed—just run the script.

You're all set to easily replicate the setup anywhere! 🚀
